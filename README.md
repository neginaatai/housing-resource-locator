# Housing Resource Locator
## Overview

The Housing Resource Locator is a desktop application designed to help Chicago residents find affordable housing resources and support services in their area. Users can search for housing assistance programs, shelters, and community resources by zip code or browse all available options across the city.

This application was built to address the need for accessible, centralized information about housing resources, making it easier for individuals and families to connect with the help they need.

## Purpose

- **Simplifies the search process** - Quick zip code lookup
- **Provides comprehensive information** - Contact details, services offered, and locations
- **Works offline** - All data stored locally in SQLite database
- **Runs anywhere** - Cross-platform support for Windows, macOS, and Linux
